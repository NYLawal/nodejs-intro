A monolithic architecture is a software model that allows all the functionalities of a project to exist in a single codebase. Thus, it is built as a unified unit that is self-contained and independent from other applications. This means that all the applicationâ€™s parts are unified and all its functions are managed in one place.

QUESTION 2
Microservice architecture is an approach to software development where the application is composed of small independent services that communicate through a central interface. An application is built as independent components that run each application process as a service, where each service performs a single function (or a couple of functions depending on the type of application). Because services are independently run, each one can be updated, deployed, and scaled to meet demand for specific functions of an application.

QUESTION 3
The microservices architecture appeals more to me. Since microservices allow tasks to be seperated into smaller processes that function independently of each other and contribute to the overall whole, this allows for fast and easy independent deployment of individual features. Changes can also be made to a specific service, without the threat of bringing down the entire application, and services with more demand can be scaled easily without having to scale the entire application. This scaling can also be reversed when demand is less. These powerful features of microservices and the many more it has to offer, make it appeal better than monolithic architecture.
Although microservices can mean additional cost in terms of requiring addtional infrastructure, it enables innovation and accelerates time-to-market for new features. Its many advantages outweigh whatever disadvantage it presents.

QUESTION 4
Nodejs is a singlethreaded language, however it has the ability to be multithreaded with the use of its event loop and callback functionalities. It can therefore be uneqivocally said that it is a multithreaded language.


QUESTION 5
REPL stands for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop. It runs JavaScript directly in the terminal.
